# Walther Flemming Bot (WFlemming_bot)

**Telegram Handle**: [@WFlemming_bot](https://t.me/WFlemming_bot)

## Overview

The **Walther Flemming Bot** is a sophisticated yet user-friendly tool designed to facilitate the resolution of fundamental genetic and inorganic chemistry problems. It supports the following computations:

### Current Features:

#### Genetic Calculations:
- Complementary gene interaction
- Blood type determination
- Chromosomal behavior analysis
- Polynomial calculations related to genetic sequences

#### Inorganic Chemistry Calculations:
- Stoichiometric conversions
- Basic chemical reactions analysis
- Molecular weights and balances determination

The bot processes user inputs and outputs results in clear, well-structured tables, making it an ideal educational tool for students, researchers, and professionals in the fields of biology and chemistry.

## Planned Enhancements

In future releases, the bot's capabilities will be expanded to include more complex problems and new features:

### Advanced Genetic Calculations:
- Complex linkage analysis
- Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping
- Multi-gene interactions
- Non-Mendelian inheritance models

### Advanced Chemical Calculations:
- Organic chemistry reaction mechanisms
- Equilibrium constants and advanced reaction kinetics
- Thermodynamic properties (e.g., Gibbs free energy, enthalpy)

### Integration with SQL Database:
A structured **SQL database** will be introduced to store and manage chemical elements and their properties, such as:
- Valency
- Atomic number
- Electron configuration

This database will enable efficient lookups and flexible queries, supporting both basic and advanced chemical data attributes in future versions.
